# Utility functions for cryptographic operations using ECDSA for secure QR code generation and verification.
# This module demonstrates Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) with NIST P-256 curve,
# which is part of Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC). ECDSA provides digital signatures for
# authentication and integrity, ensuring QR codes cannot be forged or tampered with.
